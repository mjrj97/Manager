# Project description

The purpose of this project is to create software that can manage a small association's calendar, data storage, consent forms etc. in a GDPR compliant fashion (or atleast to it's best ability). The project is primarily aimed towards small associations (e.g. the Danish LM, IM), that handle sensitive data (names, ages, addresses etc.).

# Goals

- Platform-Independent (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)
- Calendar/Schedule editor
- Syncing calendars using CalDAV protocol
- Managing GDPR consent forms
- SFTP-based cloud storage
- Encryption of stored data

# Downloads

None available at the moment.

# How to contribute

The project is very much in it's infancy, and not very structured at this point in time. Contact Martin for further information.
